# Description

This project was created with the Meteor stack.  It was built to allow users to both submit and discuss links from all around the internet.  It scrapes certain selected RSS feeds as well as successfully implemented the following:

- Routing
- User Accounts
- Notifications
- Errors
- Publications/Subscriptions
- Permissions

## Quick Start

Install Meteor:

```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh
```

Create a project:

```bash
meteor create try-meteor
```

Run it:

```bash
cd try-meteor
meteor
```

## Slow Start (for developers)

If you want to run on the bleeding edge, or help develop Meteor, you
can run Meteor directly from a git checkout.

```bash
git clone git://github.com/meteor/meteor.git
cd meteor
```

If you're the sort of person who likes to build everything from scratch,
you can build all the Meteor dependencies (node.js, npm, mongodb, etc)
with the provided script. This requires git, a C and C++ compiler,
autotools, and scons. If you do not run this script, Meteor will
automatically download pre-compiled binaries when you first run it.
